<!-- The first rule we will examine comes from the most common case of function calls: 
standalone function invocation. Think of this this rule as the default catch-all 
rule when none of the other rules apply. -->

<script>
    function foo() {
        console.log( this.a );
    }

    var a = 2;

    foo(); // 2
</script>

<!-- The first thing to note, if you were not already aware, is that variables declared in the global scope, 
as var a = 2 is, are synonymous with global-object properties of the same name. They're not copies of each 
other, they are each other. Think of it as two sides of the same coin.

Secondly, we see that when foo() is called, this.a resolves to our global variable a. Why? Because in this 
case, the default binding for this applies to the function call, and so points this at the global object.

How do we know that the default binding rule applies here? We examine the call-site to see how foo() is 
called. In our snippet, foo() is called with a plain, un-decorated function reference. 

If strict mode is in effect, the global object is not eligible for the default binding, so the this is 
instead set to undefined. -->

<script>
    function foo() {
        "use strict";

        console.log( this.a );
    }

    var a = 2;

    foo(); // TypeError: `this` is `undefined`
</script>
