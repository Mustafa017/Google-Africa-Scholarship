    <!--To understand this binding, we have to understand the call-site: the location in code where a function is 
called (not where it's declared). We must inspect the call-site to answer the question: what's this "this" a 
reference to?

Finding the call-site is generally: "go locate where a function is called from", but it's not always that 
easy, as certain coding patterns can obscure the true call-site.

What's important is to think about the call-stack (the stack of functions that have been called to get us 
to the current moment in execution). The call-site we care about is in the invocation before the currently 
executing function.-->
<script>
    function baz() {
        // call-stack is: `baz`
        // so, our call-site is in the global scope
    
        console.log( "baz" );
        bar(); // <-- call-site for `bar`
    }
    
    function bar() {
        // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar`
        // so, our call-site is in `baz`
    
        console.log( "bar" );
        foo(); // <-- call-site for `foo`
    }
    
    function foo() {
        // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar` -> `foo`
        // so, our call-site is in `bar`
    
        console.log( "foo" );
    }
    
    baz(); // <-- call-site for `baz`
    </script>
    
    <!-- Take care when analyzing code to find the actual call-site (from the call-stack), because it's the only 
    thing that matters for this binding.
    
    Nothing But Rules
    We turn our attention now to how the call-site determines where this will point during the execution 
    of a function.

You must inspect the call-site and determine which of 4 rules applies. We will first explain each of these 
4 rules independently, and then we will illustrate their order of precedence, if multiple rules could apply 
to the call-site. -->
